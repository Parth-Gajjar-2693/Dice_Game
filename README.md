Dice Game
----------
This project is a Dice Game created using React.js, with a focus on using styled components for custom styling. The game begins with an interactive landing page that features a "Play Now" button. Clicking this button redirects the user to the main game interface, where they can engage in the game.

Key Features and Components:
---------------------------
GamePlay (GamePlay.jsx): Acts as the central component that manages the game logic and state. It coordinates interactions between the other components and ensures a smooth gameplay experience.

NumberSelector (NumberSelector.jsx): This component allows players to select a number, which they think will appear on the dice. It adds an interactive element to the game.

RollDice (RollDice.jsx): Responsible for simulating the dice roll. It handles the animation and displays the result to the user, making the game visually engaging.

Rules (Rules.jsx): Provides the player with the rules and instructions on how to play the game. This ensures that players understand the gameplay mechanics.

StartGame (StartGame.jsx): Contains the landing page content where the "Play Now" button is located. This component serves as the entry point to the game.

TotalScore (TotalScore.jsx): Keeps track of and displays the player's score throughout the game, adding a competitive aspect.

Technologies Used:
-----------------
React.js: For building the user interface and managing the component-based structure.
Styled Components: For creating modular and reusable styles that are scoped to each component.

This project showcases the use of React.js for building interactive web applications and demonstrates how styled components can be used to manage styles effectively in a React project.
